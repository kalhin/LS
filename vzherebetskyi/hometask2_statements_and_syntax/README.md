Hometask 2: Statements and Syntax
======================================
Details on Methods and Input Formats
--------------------------------------

Class DumbMap is an object set to create and maintain a simple hashtable. It is used for solutions of tasks â„– 27,28 and 38.
The main object that contains all methods is called hometask2.
Every method is named after the task which it solves.
So, to run a method for the task 1 you need to run hometask2.task1(*input*) and for the task 20 it is necessary to run hometask2.task20(*input*).

General information on all methods and their inputs.

1. For the task 1 you need to run the method  **hometask2.task1(*array, testValue*)**. The *testvalue* shall be a value that you want to check.
2. For the task 2 you need to run the method  **hometask2.task2(*array*)**. *array* is an input with values that you want to check.
3. For the task 3 you need to run the method  **hometask2.task3(*array,n*)**. *n* is a number of random elements that shall be selected from the array.
4. For the task 4 you need to run the method  **hometask2.task4(*array1, array2*)**. *array1* is a main array and *array2* is an array the you want to check (if first and last element of the *array1* are equivalent to the *array2*).
5. For the task 5 (to compute the sum of all elements of an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task5(*array*)**.
6. For the task 6 (to remove the repeated elements from an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task6(*array*)**.
7. For the task 7 (to check the equivalence of the first or last element of an array1 and array2) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task7(*array1, array2*)**.
8. For the task 8 (to remove blank elements from an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task8(*array*)**.
9. For the task 9 (to split a string) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task9(*string*)**.
10. For the task 10 (to rotate elements of an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task10(*array*)**.

17. For the task 17 (to find the number of even integers in an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task17(*array*)**.
18. For the task 18 (to find the difference between the largest and smallest values of an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task18(*array*)**.
19. For the task 19 (to compute the average except the largest and smallest values of an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task19(*array*)**.
20. For the task 20 (to compute the sum of elements of an array except the number 17 and elements that come after the number 17) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task20(*array*)**.
21. For the task 21 (to compute the sum of every third element of an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task21(*array*)**.
22. For the task 22 (to check whether every element is 3 or 5 in an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task22(*array*)**.
23. For the task 23 (to check whether an element (*n*) appears "everywhere" in an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task23(*array, n*)**.
24. For the task 24 (3 next to 3 or 5 next to 5 but not both) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task24(*array*)**.
25. For the task 25 (two 6's next to each other or separated by one number) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task25(*array*)**.
26. For the task 26 (2 with 3 somewhere later) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task26(*array*)**.
27. For the task 27 (to convert an array into an index hash) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task27(*array*)**.
28. For the task 28 (to find the most occured item in an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task28(*array*)**.
29. For the task 29 (to check whether all elements are identical in an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task29(*array*)**.
30. For the task 30 (to find items in an array that start from a *string*) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task30(*array*)**.
31. For the task 31 (to iterate through an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task31(*array*)**.
32. For the task 32 (to iterate over first *n* elements of an array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task32(*array, n*)**.
33. For the task 33 (to sort a given array of strings by their length) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task33(*array*)**.
34. For the task 34 (to remova all 0 an array and set -1 on the right of the array) you need to run the method  **hometask2.task34(*array*)**.
