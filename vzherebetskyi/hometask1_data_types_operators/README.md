Hometask 1: Data Types and Operators
======================================
Details on Methods and Input Formats
--------------------------------------

In the beginning a single object named "hometask1" was created. Next, for every task (except the task №1 and task №7 concerning the filename) a different method of the hometask1 object was used:

1. For the first task it was decided to implement it using a different .html file. To check the js version you need to open the js_version.html file in your browser.
2. Starting from the second task all tasks (except the task №35 as it is the same as the task №25) were implemented via a different method.<br>So, to test the task №2 it is necessary to run **hometask1.date()**. No input is necessary.
3. To test the task №3 you need to run **hometask1.copies(*string*, *number*)** where a *string* and *number* are inputs. The *string* contains a sequence of characters you want to copy and the *number* is number of copies.
4. The method **hometask1.circle()** (the task №4) shall be run in a browser as it uses *prompt()*. After you run the method you will be asked to enter the radius of the circle.
5. To test whether the string begins from "if" (the task №5) you have to run the method **hometask1.ifBegin(*string*)** where *string* is an input that you want to check.
6. The method **hometask1.reverseName()** (the task №6) shall be run in a browser as it uses *prompt()* After you run the method you will be asked to enter the name and surname.
7. The task №7 concerning the filename was decided to skip.
8. For the task №8 you have to run the method **hometask1.smallTest(*array*)** where *array* contains 3 numbers. For instance: [2,11,42].
9. For the task №9 you have to run the method **hometask1.smallTest2(*array*)** where *array* contains 2 numbers. For instance: [2,42].
